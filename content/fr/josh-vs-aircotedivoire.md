A word from the author: Before diving in, let me be clear:  I have no particular allegiance to Air Côte d'Ivoire. In fact, I'm a big fan of your work, Josh. I've followed your channel for years and genuinely appreciate the transparency and detail you bring to aviation reviews. This analysis comes from that place of respect for both parties involved - which is exactly why I think this particular story deserves a closer look at all the pieces.

## Josh Cahill Meets Air Côte d'Ivoire (And Drama Ensues)

Josh Cahill, renowned aviation vlogger, recently published a video recounting his latest adventures with Air Côte d'Ivoire. This video triggered a major online controversy, sparking passionate reactions from fans and critics alike. It must be said that Josh didn't mince words about his experience with the Ivorian airline.

## It's A SCAM.

Has he declared, following a series of inconveniences encountered before and during his flight. The problems began at check-in, where JC had an unpleasant surprise: having mentally prepared to fly business class, he found himself in economy, without clear explanation from ground staff.

## A detail that changes the altitude of the debate

His business class ticket at €1,000.
For a Paris-Abidjan business class flight, this is unusually low. Air Côte d'Ivoire's normal fare runs around €2,200-2,300.
Even more revealing: a ground agent explicitly mentioned that this type of problem frequently occurs with reservations made via Booking.com. Yet in his video, JC completely omits mentioning the intermediary. All the blame is directed solely at Air Côte d'Ivoire.
Maybe an oversight, but a significant one. 
For such an experienced traveler - over 800 flights - this omission raises questions. Travel professionals know that bookings via online travel agencies can generate management turbulence that only the intermediary can resolve. The choice not to mention this detail in a public review raises questions about the completeness of the review.
In laymen's terms: if you book through a third party, any issues often stem from that intermediary, not the airline itself. Omitting this fact skews the narrative and unfairly targets the airline.

## Air Côte d'Ivoire: high-altitude recovery... followed by an improvised landing
Despite the rocky start, Air Côte d'Ivoire managed an impressive recovery mid-flight. The chief ground agent personally intervened, upgrading JC to a better seat and ensuring a quality service for the remainder of the journey. This demonstrated a commendable commitment to customer satisfaction.
That said, Air Côte d'Ivoire didn't navigate smooth skies either. Their performance proved extremely uneven.

### What took off:

A brand new, well-equipped Airbus A330-900 Neo
High-altitude recovery with an upgrade initiated by the station manager
Quality onboard service during the outbound flight

### What crashed

- A chaotic check-in process that got the experience off to a bad start
- Less convincing crew service on the return flight
- Post-incident follow-up could be better: no official explanation, no formal apology, no refund of the fare difference . This last point represents a real air pocket in their strategy. Even after upgrading the passenger during the flight, ACI never contacted JC again. For a company seeking to take flight in the long-haul market, this lack of after-sales service is a missed opportunity. Moreover, blocking JC on Instagram - blocking an influencer with nearly a million subscribers - transforms poor management into a delicate situation. This confrontational approach reinforces the impression of a "power struggle" rather than a willingness to dialogue.


### An escalation that raises questions

In his video, JC uses particularly strong terms like "segregation" and "racist" to describe certain incidents that seem relatively minor: difficulties filming, a wait at boarding. For someone already banned from flying Qatar Airways, one wonders if there isn't a tendency to amplify situations.
Do these serious accusations deserve to be used for these specific incidents? The question remains in holding pattern, but the use of this rhetoric certainly contributes to the intensity of the controversy.

## The real flight lesson

Ultimately, this affair illustrates how a succession of misunderstandings on both sides can create a media storm where a bit of professionalism and good faith would have allowed a smooth flight.
This type of incident can happen to any airline, especially during an inaugural flight when teams are still finding their rhythm. What really matters is the ability to learn from these turbulences. Air Côte d'Ivoire has already shown it knows how to react in-flight with its spontaneous upgrade and quality equipment.
For influencers: transparency is the flight instrument of credibility. Omitting important information, even unintentionally, transforms a legitimate critique into an incomplete narrative. With great reach comes great responsibility - and nearly a million subscribers means your words carry weight that can either build bridges or burn them. A more complete picture, including the Booking.com factor, would have served both your audience and the truth better.
I'm convinced that with a bit more experience and better after-sales service structure, Air Côte d'Ivoire will navigate more serenely in the competitive long-haul skies. African airlines have every right to their place on the international stage, and this incident is just one flight lesson among others on the path to maturity.
Both parties have room to grow: one in operational excellence and customer care, the other in journalistic completeness. That's not criticism - that's an opportunity for everyone to fly higher next time.

## A closing note
As a final word, Josh, you'd better get used to seeing terms like "maudit" (cursed), "ton b####" (and other colorful expressions) flourishing in your comments section. West African internet culture has its own unique flavor when it comes to expressing displeasure, and you are about to get a good taste of it.
And if you speak a wee bit of French, I'd recommend reading this piece on crisis management: https://jeanluchouedanou.blogspot.com/2024/03/la-regle-des-72-heures-ou-comment-gerer.html - it might offer some perspective on how things could have been handled differently on both sides.
Safe travels, and here's hoping your next African adventure goes more smoothly. ✈️
