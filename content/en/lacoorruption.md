# Corruption Will Slow You Down: A (Small) Concrete Example

Here's a situation that might seem trivial, but it reflects a deeply rooted reality in Africa, often ignored or simply accepted.

There are places I hate going to. Two, in particular:
- 🏥 **Hospitals**
- 🏦 **Banks**

Why? It's simple: endless queues and these little schemes where some people, thanks to special privileges, try to cut in front of everyone. A game I never wanted to participate in.

But sometimes, you don't have a choice.

Last November, I found myself having to go to the Ecobank center in Aghien to renew my ATM card. When I arrived at 7am, the scene was set: **a long queue**.

No choice, I had to be patient.

### A Well-Oiled "Service"

After 30 minutes of waiting, I'm approached by **👮🏿‍♂️ "the head of security"**, who comes up to me and says in a conspiratorial tone:

👮🏿‍♂️ **"Boss... what's up?"**
🧑🏿‍💼 **"Hello."**
👮🏿‍♂️ **"Ah, boss, you shouldn't do things this way."**
🧑🏿‍💼 **"Oh?"**
👮🏿‍♂️ **"Yes... When you come here, you see me, and we handle it quickly."**
🧑🏿‍💼 **"I understand."** (in a curt tone... yes, that morning, I was in a foul mood and not at all willing to play the game.)
👮🏿‍♂️ **"Ok, so we'll handle it later, right?"**
🧑🏿‍💼 **"I said I understand."**

Surprised by my response, he turns away with a contemptuous look.

### "Bosses" First

Another 30 minutes pass.

The bank finally opens. Who enters first? The **💼 "bosses"**, meaning those who slipped a bill to the famous chief.
As for us, the common folk, we wait some more. Fortunately, it was less hot than usual, making the wait more bearable.

Thirty minutes later, it's finally my turn.
But not without feeling the heavy gaze of the security chief.

Whatever... I cheerfully climb to the first floor, **guided by very courteous staff** (it's worth noting).

### A Nice Karma Twist

Arriving upstairs, I stumble right into a delightful conversation between two employees in charge of card changes:

👨🏿‍💼 **"Bro... who are all these people on Saturday morning?"**
👩🏿‍💼 **"Ayi... It's the same guy who sent them up."**
👨🏿‍💼 **"Han... The one who thinks he's the branch manager? Wait, these ones will go last."**

And, surprise:

👩🏿‍💼 **"Come this way, sir."**

**In 15 minutes, my card is changed.**

### Moral of the Story?
Corruption doesn't save us time.
On the contrary, **it slows everyone down.**
