# Anne, Brad Pitt and the €800,000: A Spectacular Scam and a Digital Lynching

_Preamble: This grim story has its roots in my home country, Benin. According to recent updates, the competent authorities have been informed of this case, and the scammers responsible have been identified by Find My Scammer. They will likely face a long prison sentence, ensuring that justice is served. These individuals in no way represent the traditional values of respect, human dignity, and hospitality that Benin is known for._  
_In other words, we can discuss this with peace of mind, without exploiting the despair and distress of the victims._

My use of social media is limited. I mostly focus on YouTube, which I listen to in the background while doing other tasks, and a few accounts dedicated to sharing content from my blogs. Yet, the social network X (formerly Twitter) continues to intrigue me. This digital world seems to operate by its own rules, where anything goes and everything is possible.

A recent example perfectly illustrates the extremes of this platform: the Anne case. A woman fell victim to a scammer impersonating Brad Pitt, who managed to swindle her out of a staggering €800,000 in just a year. Following a documentary recounting this story, Twitter quickly turned into a space for collective derision. In a matter of hours, what should have remained a private tragedy became a public spectacle.

Short excerpts from the documentary, often taken out of context, began circulating. The most striking parts were turned into memes and fueled a frenzy of jokes and parodies. The hashtag "Brad Pitt" went viral, driven by mocking comments and increasingly cruel spoofs. This phenomenon feeds itself, as everyone competes to add their "contribution."

But behind the laughter lies a more complex story.

## A Sophisticated Scam

Before this incident, Anne was already facing significant challenges. She was battling brain cancer, living with HIV, and recovering from a difficult divorce. In 2023, she discovered social media—a world she was unfamiliar with and unaware of the many traps lurking within: image manipulation, identity theft, deep fakes, and more.

It all started with an innocuous message from a woman claiming to be Brad Pitt's mother. This person built a rapport with Anne, communicating with her regularly. Gradually, other characters entered the story: Brad Pitt himself, his agent, and his manager.

The scammers were highly resourceful. They fabricated fake press articles, doctored videos, forged official documents, and even produced counterfeit passports. They used American phone numbers to enhance the illusion.

The trap closed when the fake Brad Pitt revealed he was suffering from kidney cancer. Anne, moved by this revelation, began responding to financial requests. Over 18 months, she transferred a total of €830,000, genuinely believing she was helping a distressed celebrity.

## Dire Consequences

This ordeal has left Anne destitute. She now lives in a 6m² storage unit, surrounded by a few cardboard boxes. She has attempted suicide several times and is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment.

Even more striking is the impact of the digital lynching she is enduring. Instead of condemning the scam, social media users have focused on mocking her, amplifying the ridicule with memes and parodies.

## A Wake-Up Call for the Digital World

The Anne case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of the digital world, where scams grow increasingly sophisticated, and the viral nature of content can turn personal tragedies into public spectacles.

It also raises important questions: How far are we willing to go for entertainment? What are the real impacts of our comments on the individuals involved?

This is not just the story of a vulnerable woman. It is also a cautionary tale about the potential excesses of a digital age where ethical boundaries are often blurred.

Let us strive to make it better by being more humane.
