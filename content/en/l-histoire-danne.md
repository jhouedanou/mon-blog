# Anne, the fake Brad Pitt and a digital lynching

_Preamble: This grim story has its roots in my home country, Benin. According to recent updates, the competent authorities have been informed of this case, and the scammers responsible have been identified by Find My Scammer. They will likely face a long prison sentence, ensuring that justice is served. These individuals in no way represent the traditional values of respect, human dignity, and hospitality that Benin is known for._  
_In other words, we can discuss this with peace of mind, without exploiting the despair and distress of the victims._

My use of social media is limited. I mainly focus on YouTube, which I listen to in the background during my activities, and a few accounts meant to share the content of my blogs.

Yet, the social network X (formerly Twitter) continues to intrigue me. This digital world seems to operate by its own rules, where anything goes, and anything can happen.

A recent example perfectly illustrates its excesses: the Anne case. A woman, the victim of a scammer pretending to be Brad Pitt, who extorted a colossal sum of 800,000 euros from her in just one year. Following a report recounting this story, Twitter quickly turned into a space of collective mockery. In just a few hours, what should have remained a private matter became a public spectacle.

Excerpts from the report, often taken out of context, circulated online. The most striking segments were turned into memes and fueled an escalation of jokes and parodies. The hashtag "Brad Pitt" went viral, driven by mocking comments and sometimes cruel parodies. This phenomenon feeds on itself, with everyone trying to outdo others with their "contribution."

But behind these laughs lies a more complex story.

Even before this case, Anne was already facing significant hardships. She was battling brain cancer, living with HIV, and had just gone through a difficult divorce. In 2023, she discovered social media, a world she was still new to, unaware of the many traps lurking within: manipulated images, identity theft, deep fakes, etc.

It all began with an innocent message from a woman claiming to be Brad Pitt’s mother. This person built a trusting relationship with Anne, regularly writing to her. Gradually, other characters entered the story: Brad Pitt himself, his agent, his manager. The scammers were incredibly resourceful. They created fake press articles, doctored videos, official documents, and even forged passports. They used American phone numbers to reinforce the illusion.

The trap closed when the fake Brad Pitt announced he was suffering from kidney cancer. Anne, moved by this revelation, began responding to the financial requests made to her. Over a year and a half, she transferred a total of 830,000 euros, convinced she was helping a distressed celebrity.

This case left Anne destitute. Today, she lives in a 6 m² box surrounded by a few cardboard boxes. She has attempted suicide several times and is now undergoing psychiatric treatment. Even more striking is the impact of the digital harassment she faces. Social media, instead of condemning the scam, focuses on her, multiplying mockery and ridicule.

Put simply: Anne has become the new "punchline" or "punching bag" of X. This situation has been amplified by the fact that most people don’t know Anne. They don’t know what she has endured, what she has done to survive, or that she is living with HIV and has attempted suicide three times.

We all make mistakes, but everyone deserves a minimum level of respect. Stay responsible. There are moments when silence is golden: if you’re not sure that what you’re about to post will do good, just keep scrolling.
