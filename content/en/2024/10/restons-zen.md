# The Microphone and Water Glass Theory: A Survival Guide for the Age of Unsolicited Opinions

Let me introduce you to Sandra.
You know, the one who performs Lumidee's "Never Leave You" at karaoke with passion inversely proportional to her talent.
Now imagine giving her a professional Shure microphone, the same model Beyoncé uses on tour.
**That won't make her a better singer, will it?**

That's exactly what happened with the internet: we've given professional microphones to people who should have remained in the audience. But unlike karaoke, you can't quietly slip away. Hence the importance of having a strategy. This is where the water glass theory comes in.

## The Water Glass Principle

The concept is disarmingly simple: while others shout themselves hoarse into their latest-model microphones, you quietly sip your glass of water. Why water? Because it's:

- Transparent (like your indifference to their provocations)
- Refreshing (like your serene attitude)
- Essential (like preserving your mental health online)

## The Virtuosos of Unsolicited Microphones (and How to Soothe Them with Your Glass)

### The Digital Ex

**At the mic**: On TikTok or Facebook, your former partner "shares their healing journey" (understand: posts resentment-filled videos about your relationship, with plenty of jabs at you) since your separation.

**Your water glass**: While they produce content in their bedroom (with their pet making noise in the background), you continue living your best life.
And that's precisely what irritates them.
Take a sip of water and remember: "Silence is the most elegant response, and happiness is the best revenge."

### The Self-Proclaimed Expert

You innocently post: "My xxxxx connection gives me complete satisfaction."
**At the mic**: "MY INTERNET CONNECTION IS SUPERIOR! I HAVE TWO DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN NETWORKING!"

**Your water glass**: A concise response: "Thank you for your contribution, though it wasn't solicited."
Then savor your water while they strive to demonstrate their expertise. Get a pitcher ready, as they can talk for a while, and each mention of their "years of experience" deserves a serene sip.

Then, add the finishing touch.

"Sir/Madam. I didn't ask for your opinion."
Then you can quietly sip your water while they choke on their unsolicited expertise.

### The Digital Prophet

**At the mic**: "Switching to web development? The market is saturated! My nephew makes budget websites and still struggles to find clients!"

**Your water glass**: Calmly enjoy your drink while checking your professional opportunities. When they add "Artificial Intelligence will change everything," pour yourself a second glass. These same oracles predicted the end of the Internet in 2000... right before creating their Facebook profiles.

## Why This Approach Works

While they strain to make their voices heard, you:

- Maintain zen master-level serenity
- Preserve your energy for constructive activities
- Avoid what they call in Abidjan "the life" (meaning: pointless drama)

The louder they get, the more your serenity gets hydrated. It's scientifically proven.

## The Wisdom of the Water Glass

The true power of the water glass lies in keeping your hands occupied. When tempted to respond to an unconstructive comment, take a sip of water instead. At worst, you'll be perfectly hydrated.

At best, you'll have avoided countless unproductive debates.

## In Conclusion

The internet has democratized speaking out, but no one is obligated to attend every performance. Sometimes, the most appropriate response is to elegantly withdraw, water glass in hand, leaving others to perform their solo acts.

Essential reminder: having a microphone doesn't automatically make what you say relevant. Sandra's example proves this perfectly.

P.S.: My apologies, Sandra, for using this illustration. Your enthusiasm remains admirable, even though "Never Leave You" never really recovered, and from her golden retirement, Lumidee now thinks that perhaps she wasn't such a bad singer after all.

N.B.: In certain circumstances, the water glass can be enhanced with fresh mint. But that's another theory entirely.
